**Titanic Prediction Kaggle Challenge**
This repository contains the code and documentation for the famous Titanic prediction challenge on Kaggle. The goal of this challenge is to use machine learning techniques to predict the survival outcome of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and cabin.

**Kaggle Challenge Details**
**Challenge Name:** Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
**Website:** Kaggle Titanic Challenge
**Description:** The challenge is to build a predictive model that accurately determines whether a given passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on their attributes.
**Evaluation:** The performance of the predictive model is evaluated using the accuracy metric. The predicted survival outcomes are compared to the actual outcomes to calculate the accuracy score.

**Repository Structure**
The repository is structured as follows:
**data/:** This directory contains the dataset files provided by Kaggle. It includes both the training set (train.csv) and the test set (test.csv) for the Titanic challenge.
**notebooks/:** This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate different approaches and techniques for solving the Titanic prediction problem.
**src/:** This directory contains the source code files for the Titanic prediction models. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
**README.md:** This file provides an overview of the repository and instructions for running the code.
**Getting Started**
To get started with the Titanic prediction challenge, follow these steps:

**Clone the repository to your local machine:**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-prediction.git
Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing the dependencies. Use pip to install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:
cd titanic-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Explore the notebooks/ directory to gain insights into different techniques and approaches for solving the Titanic prediction problem.
Run the code in the src/ directory to preprocess the data, engineer features, train models, and evaluate their performance.
Once you have trained your model, you can use it to make predictions on the test set provided by Kaggle (data/test.csv). Ensure that the input data is properly preprocessed before making predictions.
